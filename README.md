# pythonVirus
A virus that infect through only python

Virus was activated py >python3 virus.py command
Its code was encrypted by default and added manuelly to virus.py file.
Not encrypted code was given in Original_Code.py and this file was encrypted manuelly 
by using simple encryption loop ,so this file is just decrypted version of ciper in in virus.py

Virus.py has cipher text, key, their decode loop and exec command to execute the decrypted code

Decrypted code first create random new key and encrypt the decrypted code again for infection.
Then add the decryption loop to the cipher and key and create copy of the virus.
After that it search the .py files for infection and check it whether infected before or not.
If not infected before then add the copy of the virus beginning of the file.
Lastly it make the payload part and just print the text "Malicious Activity"
